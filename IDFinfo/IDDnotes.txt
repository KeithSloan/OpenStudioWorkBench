4.1. IDD CONVENTIONS 13
! \ retaincase Retains the alphabetic case for alpha type fields
!
! \key Possible value for "\ type choice" (blanks are significant )
! use multiple \key lines to indicate all valid choices
!
! \object -list Name of a list of user - provided object names that are valid
! entries for this field (used with "\ reference ")
! see Zone and BuildingSurface :Detailed objects below for
! examples .
! ** Note that a field may have multiple \object -list commands .
!
! \external -list The values for this field should be selected from a special
! list generated outside of the IDD file. The choices for the
! special lists are:
! autoRDDvariable
! autoRDDmeter
! autoRDDvariableMeter
! When one of these are selected the options for the field
! are taken from the RDD or MDD file or both.
!
! \ reference Name of a list of names to which this object belongs
! used with "\ type object -list" and with "\ object -list"
! see Zone and BuildingSurface :Detailed objects below for
! examples :
!
! Zone ,
! A1 , \field Name
! \type alpha
! \ reference ZoneNames
!
! BuildingSurface :Detailed ,
! A4 , \field Zone Name
! \note Zone the surface is a part of
! \type object -list
! \object -list ZoneNames
!
! For each zone , the field "Name" may be referenced
! by other objects , such as BuildingSurface :Detailed , so it is
! commented with "\ reference ZoneNames "
! Fields that reference a zone name , such as BuildingSurface :Detailed 's
! "Zone Name", are commented as
! "\ type object -list" and "\ object -list ZoneNames "
! ** Note that a field may have multiple \ reference commands .
! ** This is useful if the object belongs to a small specific
! object -list as well as a larger more general object -list.
!
! Object -level comments :
!
! \memo Memo describing the object. If multiple lines , start each line
! with \memo.
! Limit line length to 100 characters .
!
! \unique -object To flag objects which should appear only once in an idf
! (this comment has no "value ")
!
! \required -object To flag objects which are required in every idf
! (this comment has no "value ")
!
! \min -fields Minimum number of fields that should be included in the
! object. If appropriate , the Input Processor will fill
! any missing fields with defaults (for numeric fields).
! It will also supply that number of fields to the "get"
! routines using blanks for alpha fields (note -- blanks
! may not be allowable for some alpha fields).
!
! \obsolete This object has been replaced though is kept (and is read)
! in the current version. Please refer to documentation as
! to the dispersal of the object. If this object is
! encountered in an IDF , the InputProcessor will post an
! appropriate message to the error file.
! usage: \obsolete New = >[New object name]
!
! \ extensible :<\#> This object is dynamically extensible -- meaning , if you
! change the IDD appropriately (if the object has a simple list
! structure -- just add items to the list arguments (i.e. BRANCH
! LIST). These will be automatically redimensioned and used during
! the simulation . <\#> should be entered by the developer to signify
! how many of the last fields are needed to be extended (and EnergyPlus
! will attempt to auto -extend the object). The first field of the first
! instance of the extensible field set is marked with \begin - extensible .
!
! \begin - extensible See previous item , marks beginning of extensible fields in
! an object.
!
! \format The object should have a special format when saved in
! the IDF Editor with the special format option enabled.
! The options include SingleLine , Vertices , CompactSchedule ,
! FluidProperties , ViewFactors , and Spectral.
! The SingleLine option puts all the fields for the object
! on a single line. The Vertices option is used in objects
! that use X, Y and Z fields to format those three fields
! on a single line.
! The CompactSchedule formats that specific object.
! The FluidProperty option formats long lists of fluid
! properties to ten values per line.
! The ViewFactor option formats three fields related to
! view factors per line.
! The Spectral option formats the four fields related to
! window glass spectral data per line.
!
! \reference -class -name Adds the name of the class to the reference list
! similar to \ reference .
!
! Group -level comments :
!
! \group Name for a group of related objects
!
!
! Notes on comments
! -----------------
!
! 1. If a particular comment is not applicable (such as units , or default)
! then simply omit the comment rather than indicating N/A.
!
! 2. Memos and notes should be brief ( recommend 5 lines or less per block).
